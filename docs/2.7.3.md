[ProxySQL](https://proxysql.com/) is a high-performance proxy for MySQL and MySQL-compatible database servers such as Percona Server for MySQL and MariaDB. It acts as an intermediary for client requests seeking resources from the database. ProxySQL was created for the database administrator to solve complex replication topology issues. Percona distributes ProxySQL as a repackaged version of the upstream release, without making any code modifications. 

You can [download the original ProxySQL from GitHub](https://github.com/sysown/proxysql/releases). The [ProxySQL documentation](https://proxysql.com/documentation/) provides information on installing and running ProxySQL.

The [ProxySQL Admin (proxysql-admin)](proxysql-admin-tool-v2-config.md) tool simplifies the configuration of Percona XtraDB Cluster nodes with ProxySQL.  [ProxySQL Admin 2](proxysql-admin-tool-functions.md) supports Percona XtraDB Cluster without custom scripts.

The [pxc_scheduler_handler](psh-overview.md) tool can automatically perform a failover due to node failures, service degradation, or maintenance. This tool has features and capabilities that differ from the ProxySQL admin tool, so you should not use options from one tool in the other, as that may cause unintended results.

## Release highlights

This release introduces Percona's build of ProxySQL 2.7.3, incorporating the latest upstream features and improvements. Instead of releasing a Percona build of ProxySQL 2.7.2, we are skipping to 2.7.3. This version includes all enhancements and bug fixes from upstream [ProxySQL 2.7.2] and [ProxySQL 2.7.3].

* Added a configurable feature for logging and analyzing events and queries, providing real-time understanding of how applications are interacting with the database and its performance.

* Added support for PMM metrics (`runtime_mysql_servers_*`) through the Prometheus exporter, helping you monitor and troubleshoot your database efficiently.

* Introduced flexibility in query configurations with support for `@@session` and `@global` variables in `SET` statements.

* Resolved collation mismatches between the client (frontend) and the server (backend) when collation IDs exceed 255, ensuring consistent query results.

* Fixed issues with DELETE operations in the stats memory database, improving reliability during maintenance tasks.

## No changes

The [ProxySQL Admin] tool and the [pxc_scheduler_handler] tool within Percona's Build of ProxySQL 2.7.3 have not been updated and are the same as in the previous Percona release.

## Known issues

In an MySQL 8.4 or Percona Server for MySQL 8.4 environment, you may have the following issues:

* ProxySQL contains counters that have not been updated to use the new terminology. Unexpected results may occur
* The binlog reader errors out during initialization due to the use of the old terminology, such as SHOW MASTER STATUS command.
